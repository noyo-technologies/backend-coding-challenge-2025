# Sales Force Location Tracking System

## Overview
Welcome to the Sales Force Location Tracking System! This system helps companies manage and track where their sales representatives are located throughout their travels, which is crucial for territory management, customer visits, and travel planning.

## Domain Context

### What are Segments?
A segment represents a period of time when a sales representative is at a specific location. Think of it as a "visit" or "stay" at a particular place. For example:
- A sales rep staying at the Marriott in Chicago for a week of client meetings
- A day trip to visit multiple clients in downtown Boston
- A morning meeting at a client's office followed by an afternoon at a different client's location
- A weekend stay at a hotel before Monday morning meetings

Each segment has:
- A start date (when the sales rep arrived at the location)
- An optional end date (when they left)
- Location details (city, state, zip code)

### Why is this Important?
Companies need to track sales rep locations for various reasons:
- Territory management (ensuring proper coverage)
- Travel expense tracking and validation
- Customer visit planning and optimization
- Emergency response (knowing who's in which city)
- Travel policy compliance
- Meeting scheduling and coordination

## The Challenge

### Background
You're joining a fast-growing sales organization that's rapidly expanding across multiple territories. The company has been manually tracking sales rep locations in spreadsheets, but this is becoming unsustainable as they:
- Add more sales territories
- Increase travel frequency
- Need real-time location data
- Require better travel expense reporting
- Need to optimize travel routes and schedules

### Your Mission
Build a robust system to manage sales rep location segments that can:
1. Track where sales reps are located throughout their travels
2. Handle complex scenarios like multiple locations in a day
3. Provide insights about travel patterns and territory coverage
4. Scale as the sales force grows

## Take-Home Exercise
To help you prepare for the interview, please review the basic segment management system requirements in `BASIC.md`. Your task is to:

1. Read through the requirements carefully
2. Identify any additional information you might need
3. Come prepared with questions about:
   - Any unclear requirements
   - Edge cases you'd like to discuss
   - Technical constraints or considerations
   - Business rules that need clarification

This preparation will help us have a more productive discussion during the interview. We'll work through the implementation together, so there's no need to write any code beforehand.

Note: This is an optional exercise. You can also come to the interview fresh and we'll work through the basic implementation together.

## Using Modern Tools

We embrace modern development tools and workflows. During your interview:

- **Feel free to use any tools you'd normally use** - Including Google, Stack Overflow, or documentation
- **We encourage the use of AI assistants** - We use Cursor at Noyo, and your interview will mirror how we actually collaborate on problems. We're very interested in how you leverage these tools effectively as part of your workflow.
- **Be prepared to explain your approach** - The ability to effectively integrate modern tools while maintaining critical thinking and sound engineering judgment is a valuable skill. We want to see how you combine your expertise with the tools available to solve complex problems efficiently.

## Interview Structure
The interview will consist of three parts, each building upon the previous:
1. Basic Segment Management (pre-work)
2. Analytics and Validation
3. Multi-Person Relationships

Each part will test different aspects of system design, implementation, and problem-solving skills. Time management will be paramount - we'll work together to ensure we cover the most important aspects of each part while maintaining a good pace through the interview.

## Getting Started
1. Review the requirements in `BASIC.md`
2. Set up your development environment
3. Implement the basic segment management system
4. Be prepared to discuss your implementation and tackle more complex challenges during the interview

Good luck!
